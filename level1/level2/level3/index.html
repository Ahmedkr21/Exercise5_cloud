        <p>IaaS is the foundational layer of cloud computing. It offers users virtualized computing resources, such as virtual machines, storage, and networking, providing the building blocks necessary for IT infrastructure. IaaS users have control over the operating systems, applications, and data they deploy on these virtualized resources. This model is well-suited for businesses seeking flexibility and scalability while maintaining control over their software stack and configurations.

            PaaS takes the cloud a step further by abstracting even more of the underlying infrastructure, focusing on the development and deployment of applications. PaaS providers deliver platforms and tools for developers to build, test, and deploy applications without concerning themselves with the underlying hardware or operating system. This model accelerates application development, promotes collaboration among development teams, and streamlines the deployment process.
            
            SaaS is the most user-centric cloud service delivery model, providing fully developed applications directly to end-users over the internet. Users access software applications via web browsers, eliminating the need for local installations and maintenance. SaaS is ideal for businesses seeking rapid access to software without the complexities of deployment and management. Popular examples of SaaS applications include email services like Gmail, office suites like Microsoft 365, and customer relationship management (CRM) tools like Salesforce.</p>
